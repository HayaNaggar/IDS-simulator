# IoT Network Anomaly IDS Simulator

## Overview
An interactive IDS simulator designed to visualize and analyze
IoT network anomalies based on empirical research findings.

## Research Background
This project is based on research into network anomaly behavior
in IoT environments, focusing on traffic-based indicators.

## Detection Model
- Logistic Regression (research-aligned)
- Z-score normalization
- Feature contribution analysis

## Implemented Anomaly Indicators
- Packet Rate
- Latency
- Flow Duration
- Packet Length

## Simulator Capabilities
- Anomaly likelihood estimation
- Feature explainability
- Traffic visualization
- Scenario-based simulation
- Event logging

## Disclaimer
This simulator is intended for research and educational purposes.
It is not a production intrusion detection system.
